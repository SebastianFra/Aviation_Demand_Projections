Step 4: In the file "CallAviationDemand.R" insert the local path to the model folder in line 9.<br />
Step 5: Run the entire script "CallAviationDemand.R".<br />
Step 6: To visualize your results open the file "Aviation_Demand_Plots.RMD" in the model folder "./R".<br />
Step 7: Again you need to insert your individual local path to the model folder in line 13.<br />
